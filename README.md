# Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) with VQ-VAE

This repository implements a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) combined with a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) for high-quality image generation. The model is trained on a butterfly image dataset and evaluated using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID).
Model (DDPM) combined with a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) for high-qu
## Architecture Overview

The implementation consists of three main components:

1. **VQ-VAE**: Compresses images into discrete latent representations
   - Encoder: Converts images to continuous latent space
   - Vector Quantizer: Discretizes latent space using a codebook
   - Decoder: Reconstructs images from quantized representations

2. **U-Net**: Core of the diffusion model
   - Predicts noise at each timestep
   - Features skip connections and time embeddings
   - Optimized for 8x8 latent space dimensions

3. **Diffusion Process**: 
   - Forward process: Gradually adds noise to latents
   - Reverse process: Generates new samples by denoising

Usage

Train VQ-VAE:

pythonCopy# Initialize and train VQ-VAE
vqvae_model = VQVAE(embedding_dim=128, num_embeddings=1024)
# Train VQ-VAE on image dataset

Generate Latent Representations:

pythonCopy# Get VQ representations of training images
vq_representations = get_vq_representations(dataloader, VQVAE_model, device)

Train Diffusion Model:

pythonCopy# Initialize and train U-Net
u_net_model = UNet()
# Train on VQ representations

Generate Samples:

pythonCopy# Generate new samples
generated_sample = generate_sample(loaded_unet_model, num_timesteps)
decoded_image = vqvae_model.decoder(generated_sample)
